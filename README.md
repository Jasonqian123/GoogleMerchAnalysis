#### **Insights**
- **High Traffic and Revenue Contribution:**<br>
Direct traffic and Google organic search generate the highest number of sessions and contribute the most revenue. However, other sources like Google paid search (google/cpc), referral traffic (art-analytics.appspot.com/referral, sites.google.com/referral), and the November 2024 email campaign show <u><strong>exceptionally high engagement rates </strong></u>ranging from 74.3% to 81.8%, indicating strong user interaction and engagement with these sources.
- **Key Event Performance:**<br>
The November 2024 email campaign and two referral sources (sites.google.com/referral, art-analytics.appspot.com/referral) rank in the top three for Session Key Event Rate, ranging from 35.3% to 55.1%. This suggests that users from these sources are more likely to trigger important events on the website (e.g., purchases, clicks). In contrast, referral traffic from Baidu exhibits a much lower Session Key Event Rate (only 1.3%), implying that user behavior varies significantly across different referral sources.
- **Revenue Distribution:**<br>
Besides direct and organic traffic, paid search, referral, and email campaign sources collectively contribute 86.58% of the total revenue. This highlights their critical role in driving conversions and underscores the importance of optimizing these channels to maximize profitability.
